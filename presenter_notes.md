## Intro

 * Hello
   * Joe - AC - Tech Lead across team
 * What. Why you should care
   * bonkers ideas: Pair Programming, TDD & now mob programming - which goes even further - all the folk, at the same time, in the same space on the same computer
   * Can you image. All those eyes! __Kim image__ It's not like this, it's a practice designed for safe working in a group - with the focus on solving problems rather than just writing as much code as possible
   * Why: Communication problems (email two days), Decision Making (waiting for approval) & tech debt (it only takes one person to say we can do better)
 * Agenda
   * You'll hear about how it works
   * You'll get to try it
   * You'll remember to come back and share your experience

I'm going to tell you some of the specifics, but a lot of it is encapsulated in one video: __video__

## How

 * Timer
   * You'll take it in turns. Every 5 or so minutes you'll rotate and someone new will take the keyboard.
   * The person on the keyboard is not the person driving. They are merely a typist - and the mob direct them on what to do next
 * Strong-style pairing
   * For an idea to go from your brain to the computer, you have to use someone elses hands
   * Rather than "I have an idea - give me" it's "I have an idea - please take the keyboard"
   * Three things help -
     * knowing what example scenario you are solving (whiteboard it)
     * speaking at the highest level the typist can work at (extract method, highlight lines 10-14 and press Ctrl-X-M)
     * Trusting the navigators, you know the example - let them direct the solution for 4 minutes - after that you can comment
 * Safety
   * Treat each other with kindness, respect and consideration. We are putting ourselves out there and there's no room to hide.
   * Handle conflict - disagree with ideas, not the person.
   * If it's getting too much just take a time out. I'll be walking around.

## Outro
 * Intro mob bosses
 * Go to where they are

# End bit

* Three principles
  * Turn up the good - enhance it
  * Be nice -  "We made a commitment to treat each with kindness, respect and consideration" he said. "In the process, you become a better person."
  * Work sustainably - take breaks - don't break eight hours

Kindness: Act in a kindly way. Be warm-hearted, gentle and polite. Display a pleasant disposition to others. Show concern for others.

Consideration: Consider your team members’ ideas. To do this we need to be able to listen. To listen requires humility. Our own idea is only one possible way. We need to try the other ideas rather than simply finding reasons not to try them.

Respect: Respect is like a diplomatic protocol. It’s about allowing others to keep their self-esteem. We can disagree, and still be respectful. Disagreements generate ideas but those ideas cannot flourish in a disrespectful environment.
